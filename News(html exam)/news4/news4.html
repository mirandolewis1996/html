 <p>They collapsed on their knees, faces buried in their hands, eyes red and moist. The silence in the stands, a disbelieving hush that engulfed the Kalinga stadium, and the dejected shake of the head. “Mood off kar dia,” bemoaned one fan donning an Indian jersey. “Zara iss dil ka toh sochte.” Indian hockey’s history is littered with severe heartaches, each one more painful than the other. This one will linger for a while, though. For it brings a team that was flying above the clouds after winning the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics crashing down to earth.</p>

 <p>Those moments of unimaginable high under a crisp Tokyo sun now feel a world away from the lows on a breezy, nervy – and ultimately heartbreaking – night in Bhubaneswar. The gloom in the Indian dugout and the stands was an unsettling realisation that the hosts had been booted out of their own World Cup. A premature exit after New Zealand, who had billed themselves up as underdogs coming into this match, conjured up one of the upsets of the tournament in the play-off match for a place in the quarterfinal</p>

 <p>On this never-ending night of incredible hockey, India enjoyed a two-goal lead, allowed New Zealand to come back and make it 3-3, which forced the match into shootouts. In the tiebreaker, it was the Kiwis who had a two-goal advantage but PR Sreejesh’s heroics – the Indian goalkeeper limped off the field – dragged India back into the game when all seemed lost and took it to sudden death, where the hosts had the chance to win it twice but failed to capitalise on both occasions. Eventually, after they were out on the field for almost two hours, New Zealand finally clinched the tie in the 18th penalty, when goalkeeper Leon Hayward denied Shamsher Singh.</p>
