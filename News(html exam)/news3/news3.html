	<p>A massive power outage was reported in Pakistan due to a grid failure on Monday morning. Authorities said work is underway to restore the system.The Pakistan Ministry of Energy said in a tweet that the power outage was triggered by a drop in frequency of the national grid, that resulted in a widespread breakdown in the power system.Before the ministry's announcement, different power distribution companies had confirmed the power breakdown, as per Geo TV.</p>

	<p>According to Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO), the two transmission lines from Guddu to Quetta tripped. It added that 22 districts of Balochistan, including Quetta, are without power. A power outage was also reported in multiple areas of Lahore and Karachi as well.In 2021, a “technical fault” at a power plant located in southern Pakistan’s Sindh province caused a similar blackout triggered by a sudden drop in the frequency of the power transmission system from 50 to 0 in less than a second. It had a cascading effect and eventually shut down the entire power system. The power was restored a day later.</p>
